Simple andriod app that uses api to retrieve ingredients for a user searched dish.

The application is composted of 3 parts:
Dish Search: 
  This functionality allows user to type in a dish name eg 'Sandwhich' and the application uses an api
  to do a search for all dishes comprsied of this keyword and retrieve the data associated in json format.
  We parse this data and display ingredients to the user as well as provide a button to open link to the
  dish web page that shows cooking instructions etc.

Pantry:
  This is a virtual pantry that is basically a list of ingredients that user can save to keep in storage
  all the items that user has bought or already has in their actual pantry

Shopping List:
  This is a screen user can access and add either either manually or via the add ingredients button from the
  Dish Search screen.
